# The NashCoding Blackjack Framework
This framework is designed to facilitate statistics and AI research in the game of Blackjack. It should be able to simulate about 100,000 hands per second on a modern machine, and typically you need at least 100 million hands to get a stable expected value for a strategy. Although the game has been researched heavily, there are still a lot of questions to be answered particularly regarding the interaction of multiple strategies.

More information about how to use the strategy can be found on [nashcoding](http://www.nashcoding.com/2010/10/03/a-csharp-blackjack-simulation-framework/).
